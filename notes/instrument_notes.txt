bug in delay-t-eval,

- things can lock up if you schedule functions
in the loaded up file

this should work but doesn't:

(delay-t-eval 0 out 0 '(1 2 3))

- make a way to turn off logging gensym callbacks
- issue: can't add a *new* symbol using 'set 
- todo: make a macro for making a repeater

Notes on making real music:

To add:
- change loop length in a seq
- change base ticks
- create uneven rhythms
- loop len
- add base transpose

- make a base velocity for fade outs and fade in
- figure out how to make ramps over the sequences and fade in and out a map function

- loop-len should be allowed to go past the length and then know to do the modulo thing
