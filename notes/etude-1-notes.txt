Notes for etude 1

- had a crash when I told it to read during playback... file bug..

- time base offset would be good
- ability to cut off after certain number of reps

- it would be better if all attributes we want to set in real time used keywords to bypass
  quoting bs, and allow (l1 'set :foo 1 :bar 2, etc)

- ability to mute too? (ie they keep playing, but making no noise
  - can be done with the gate 

- add third pattern
- fades do sound really good, need to figure out how to add those
- morphing of accent patterns would be good too within the repeater

- need way to say : play twice only, etc
  - DONE, loop-reps attr

- need velocity offset so can mute patterns while freewheeling

- changing time factor once it's going is nice, we recognize the change
- fading in and out voices out of sync with their reverb sounds GREAT!
- should work awesome with synth voices
- ramps - created ramps

NEXT:
- add velocity offsets
- 
- gates to have automated cut in and out 

- reflect a sequence?
- play in reverse? - how would that work?

- think I had a garbage collector run and play havoc, need to try having it run all the time
- also should compare against running the dsp in live instead of in Max (probably better) 
- I think the ramp really eats processor, probably need graining on it
  - yup they do, I can run in audio interrupt without them but not with them
- could try triggering line objects with messages instead

- yes the ramps are expensive, can see the gui doesn't update once it's hammered

- NEXT: 
  - try giving the ramps a resolution setting
  - check performance against piping all midi to live instead
  - cpu use is def lower, sounds like maybe timing gets bad with no audio on in Max??
- need to make something with perc synced to live to find out if it's ok or not for real
- overall CPU use is def lower with piping to live, but not sure if timing is still saying fine or not
- Max sometimes jams out though, don't know why? And then it crashes.. WTF?
  - could just be that the schedule gets overloaded from the ramps??

- seems to work pretty well with audio on but doing nothing in Max, and piping midi
  to Live, even with ramps running in Max. BUT I haven't checked with timing lock up like metro on cymbals
  - this with audio Interupt off
- nontheless, seems like ramps every ms are dangerous, they overload the scheduler when running once per ms
- it can get overloaded, so that it can't keep up with scheduler messages
  - maybe the setting of how many to run at once will help??

- need to test with percussion
- should check with hooking up to line objects or audio dsp objects for making ramps
