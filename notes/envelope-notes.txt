Notes on implementing control envelopes
- args: start, end, dur, resolution
- can register functions in the ramp to run on every pass

- it will schedule itself on every res ticks
- once it reaches the final value, it stops
- holds a registry of functions that it will call on every tick to send
  values to places (ie sets a global variable)

(define e1 (envelope 0 1 (* 8 1920) (lambda(x)(set! g1 x)) ))
(e1 'start) (e1 'reset) (e1 'add-callback) (e1 'replace-callback)
