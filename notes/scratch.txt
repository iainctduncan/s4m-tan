Scratchpad:

what should I higher level sequencing look like?

we need a function list that calls the repeaters

(:1:1:1  1 240 Bf5 90)

- messages to it:
  'play
  'cue 
  'stop
   
- simple first implementation could be a hash-table by tick values,
  on each tick it looks for a list of values for that tick

- bbt ticks working
  - need to make it play now off either ticks or bbt number
