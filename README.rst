This is a repository for my course work for a directed studies with Dr Anthony Tan at
the University of Victoria as part of a Master's in Music Technology. The focus
of this course is compositions using Scheme for Max, exploring areas of algorithmic
composition, computer assisted composition, and live improvisation/live coding
that are enabled well by Scheme For Max. 

I am making this public so that anyone interested can benefit from the code.
